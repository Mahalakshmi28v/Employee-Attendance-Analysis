# Employee-Attendance-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing employee attendance data to identify attendance patterns, absenteeism, and late trends across departments.

## Tools & Technologies

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains employee attendance records with the following fields:

- Department-wise attendance comparison
- Percentage-based attendance analysis

## Dashboard Overview
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- KPI cards for Total Records, Present, Absent, and Late counts
- Overall attendance distribution bar chart
- Department-wise attendance status (100% stacked column chart)

## Outcome
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow from raw data cleaning to interactive dashboard development using Power BI.
